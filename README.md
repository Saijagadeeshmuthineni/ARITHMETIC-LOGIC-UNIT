# Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. It is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on, called operands, and a code indicating the operation to be performed; the ALU's output is the result of the performed operation. In many designs, the ALU also g the has status inputs or outputs, or both, which convey information about a previous operation or the current operation, respectively, between the ALU and external status registers. In this design it performs the addition, subtraction, AND, OR and NOT operations. it is compiles by using the online EDA Playground.
